Based on the datasheet, here are the relevant details for interpreting the fault status signal of the IMD (Insulation Monitoring Device) IR155-32xx:

OKHS Status Output (High Side):
Normal Condition (No Fault):

The OKHS output switches to US (supply voltage) minus 2V.
This means if the supply voltage (US) is 12V, the OKHS output will be around 10V.
Signal Level: High (US - 2V)
Fault Condition (Insulation Fault, Device Error, Earth Connection Fault, or Undervoltage Detected):

The OKHS output will be low, close to 0V.
Signal Level: Low (0V)
Summary of Fault Status Signal:
When there is no fault, the OKHS status output will be high (approximately US - 2V).
When there is a fault, the OKHS status output will be low (0V).
Practical Use:
Interfacing with the Optocoupler:

When the OKHS output is high (no fault), the optocoupler's LED will be off if connected to the output directly.
When the OKHS output is low (fault condition), the optocoupler's LED will turn on, signaling a fault.
Circuit Configuration:

Normal (No Fault): OKHS ≈ US - 2V (10V if US is 12V)
Fault: OKHS ≈ 0V
Implementation:
To use this signal in your circuit, you would connect the OKHS output to the input side of your optocoupler, with a current-limiting resistor calculated based on the supply voltage and desired forward current for the optocoupler's LED.

Example Calculation for Resistor:
Supply Voltage (US): 12V
High Signal: 10V (US - 2V)
Desired Forward Current (I_F): 15mA
Forward Voltage of Optocoupler LED (V_F): 1.2V (typical)

A standard resistor value close to this is 560Ω or 600Ω.

Conclusion:
No Fault: OKHS output ≈ 10V
Fault: OKHS output ≈ 0V
You can configure the optocoupler in your circuit to detect these levels appropriately and trigger your fault indicator mechanisms accordingly.

For further details and exact resistor values, always refer to the specific component datasheets and adjust calculations based on your circuit's requirements.
