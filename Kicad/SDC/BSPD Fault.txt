If the fault signal is 5V and the OK signal is 0V, the approach to calculate the current-limiting resistor for the optocoupler's LED will be similar. Here’s how you can determine the resistor value:

Given:
Fault Signal (High): 5V
OK Signal (Low): 0V
Desired Forward Current (I_F): 15mA (0.015A)
Forward Voltage of Optocoupler LED (V_F): 1.2V (typical for 4N25)
Calculation:
Voltage Drop Across Resistor (V_R):

When the fault signal is high (5V), the voltage drop across the resistor will be:

 ≈253.33Ω
Standard Resistor Value:
The closest standard resistor value to 253.33Ω is 270Ω. This value will ensure the current is slightly lower than the desired 15mA, which is safe for the optocoupler LED.
Implementation:
Resistor Value: 270Ω
Configuration:
Connect the fault signal (5V) to the anode of the optocoupler's LED through the 270Ω resistor.
Connect the cathode of the optocoupler's LED to ground.
When the fault signal is high (5V), the optocoupler LED will turn on.
When the fault signal is low (0V, indicating OK), the optocoupler LED will be off.
Summary:
Fault Signal (High): 5V -> Optocoupler LED turns on.
OK Signal (Low): 0V -> Optocoupler LED turns off.
Current-Limiting Resistor: 270Ω
This setup ensures that the optocoupler LED operates safely and effectively within its specified current range.
